# dup_img
find duplicate images on your computer

This electron program is intended to compare a directory with image files with another directory with images. For instance if you have a sd-card from your camera and you are not sure if all images are transferred to your hard disk, you can use this program to check this.
The principle is simple: it compares the images in a so called needle directory with images in the so called hay directory that contains all your images. 

Installation:
download the zip-file and unzip it. 

Usage:
Click on start.bat to start the program. You can enter the needle and hay directory and start the compare.
